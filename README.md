# MTA-CitiBike-Project
CitiBikes and The Subway:

- Analyzed and organized over 9 million rows of data in the Citi Bike and MTA datasets using Python and 
  SQL.
- Conducted an analysis to find the Citi Bike stations that are in proximity to the busiest subway stations
- Converted data and created new features to find the times with the highest traffic of people at the 
  subway stations to alert Citi Bike about high demand in bikes in the nearby Citi Bike stations
- Communicated findings to Citi Bike about the specific times in which some stations are subject to high 
  demand
